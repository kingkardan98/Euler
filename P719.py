# INTUITION 1: we just need to check the squares. Up to 10^12, that means only 0.000001% of all the numbers. Not bad.
# INTUITION 2: numbers in the form 10^x are guaranteed to work. However, it's such a small percentage it's not ideal to check.
# INTUITION 3: I simply need to exclude all 1-digit numbers, since they don't fit the bill for the problem. I was off by 1.
