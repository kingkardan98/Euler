Looking at the keylog.txt file, and through the intuition on martin-ueding.de,
we can see that only the digits 0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9 are used. 8 out of the 10 digits.

If the digits are always asked in order, and we assume there are no repetitions,
a graph comes to life, as shown in P79.png

Since there are 8 digits used, and the graph is 8 layers, it's just as easy as reading
a path of 8 links.
