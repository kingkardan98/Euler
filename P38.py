# What is the largest 9-digit pandigital number that can be formed
# as the concatenated product of an integer with (1, 2, ..., n), n > 1?

# C1: The ideal result would be 987654321. Is that possible though?

# C2: It can't be a number with digits just decreasing, since the
# concatenated product makes the result bigger each time.

# C3: I would need at minimum the concatenated product of (1, 2).
# Maybe a 9-starting four digit number, that multiplied goes up
# to five digits?

# Intuition: 18654 / 2 = 9327 => 932718654
# BIG INTUITION! DAAAAAAMN, it was actually correct
